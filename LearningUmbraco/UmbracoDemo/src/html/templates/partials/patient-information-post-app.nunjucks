        <h2>When you’ve been in hospital for treatment or surgery</h2>
        <p>If you have been in a Spire hospital for treatment or surgery, you will be given information about what to do when you get home.  Often this is provided by the consultant who was responsible for your care or by the hospital itself.  We’ve also detailed below some further information which may be of use to you.  Please select from the type of surgery or treatment above – if the surgery or treatment is not shown please call the hospital main reception where someone will be able to help you.</p>
